# If you have a single git repository, just put the full path to it

#
# If you have multiple repositories, you need to put %s where you

# For example:
# - You have many projects on your local computer and want to use
#   InDefero to see them. Put: '/home/yourlogin/Projects/%s/.git'
# - You have many projects on a remote server with only "bare" git
#   repositories. Put: '/home/git/repositories/%s.git'

# you can define a local repository, local repositories are defined

#
# You can setup monotone for use with indefero in several ways. The
# two most-used should be:
#
# 1) One database for everything:
#
#    Set 'mtn_repositories' below to a fixed database path, such as
#    '/home/mtn/repositories/all_projects.mtn'
#
#    Pro: - easy to setup and to manage
#    Con: - while read access can be configured per-branch,
#           granting write access rights to a user means that
#           he can write anything in the global database
#         - database lock problem: the database from which
#           indefero reads its data cannot be used to serve the
#           contents to the users, as the serve process locks
#           the database
#
# 2) One database for every project with 'usher':
#
#    Download and configure 'usher'
#    (mtn clone mtn://monotone.ca?net.venge.monotone.contrib.usher)
#    which acts as proxy in front of all single project databases.
#    Create a basic configuration file for it and add a secret admin
#    username and password. Finally, point the below variable
#    'mtn_usher_conf' to this configuration file.
#
#    Then set 'mtn_remote_url' below to a string which matches your setup.
#    Again, the '%s' placeholder will be expanded to the project's
#    short name. Note that 'mtn_remote_url' is used as internal
#    URI (to access the data for indefero) as well as external URI
#    (for end users) at the same time. 'mtn_repositories' should then
#    point to a directory where all project-related files (databases,
#    keys, configurations) are kept, as these are automatically created
#    on project creation by IDF.
#
#    Example: 'mtn_repositories' is configured to be '/var/monotone/%s'
#
#      - IDF tries to create /var/monotone/<projectname> as root directory
#      - The database is placed in as /var/monotone/<projectname>/database.mtn
#      - The server key is put into /var/monotone/<projectname>/keys and
#        is named "<projectname>-server@<host>", where host is the host part
#        of 'mtn_remote_url'
#
#    therefor /var/monotone MUST be read/writable for the www user and all
#    files which are created underknees MUST be read/writable by the user
#    who is executing the usher instance! The best way to achieve this is with
#    default (POSIX) ACLs on /var/monotone.
#
#
#    You could also choose to setup usher by hand, i.e. with individual
#    databases, in this case leave 'mtn_usher_conf' below commented out.
#
#    Pro: - read and write access can be granted per project
#         - no database locking issues
#         - one public server running on the one well-known port
#    Con: - harder to setup
#
# Usher can also be used to forward sync requests to remote servers,
# please consult its README file for more information.
#
# monotone also allows to use SSH as transport protocol, so if you do not plan
# to setup a netsync server as described above, then just enter a URI like
# 'ssh://my-host.biz/home/mtn/repositories/%s.mtn' in 'mtn_remote_url'.
#

#
# Whether the particular database(s) are accessed locally (via automate stdio)
# or remotely (via automate remote_stdio). 'remote' is the default for
# netsync setups, while 'local' access should be choosed for ssh access.
#
# Note that you need to setup the hook 'get_remote_automate_permitted' for
# each remotely accessible database. A full HOWTO set this up is beyond this
# scope, please refer to the documentation of monotone and / or ask on the
# mailing list (monotone-users@nongnu.org) or IRC channel
# (irc.oftc.net/#monotone)
