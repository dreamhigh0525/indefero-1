# InDefero 1.3 - xxx xxx xx xx:xx 2011 UTC

The development of this version of Indefero has been sponsored
by the friendly folks from Scilab <http://www.scilab.org/>!

ATTENTION: You need Pluf [4121ca4](http://projects.ceondo.com/p/pluf/source/commit/4121ca4)
or newer to properly run this version of Indefero!

## Changes

- Indefero's post-commit web hook now by default issues HTTP PUT instead of
  HTTP POST requests and carries the authentication digest in the new
  `Web-Hook-Hmac` header.  The old behaviour can be re-enabled by setting the
  `$cfg['webhook_processing']` flag to "compat", we urge you to change the
  implementations of this web hook as this setting is likely to be removed
  in future versions of Indefero.
- Indefero now needs PHP's zip module which is not enabled by default.
- Existing email notifications now have to be explicitely activated in the
  project's administrative area.

## New Features

- It is now possible to upload and embed resources like images or text
  files into wiki pages. If no preview for a resource's mime type is
  available, than a download link is provided for it instead.
- The notification system has been overhauled; it is now possible to configure
  what kind of user group, project administrators, members and / or additional
  mail addresses are notified about updates in a certain section, such as 
  issues, downloads, reviews, and so on. We now also ensure that notification
  emails for one object are uniquely identifyable to support a grouped view
  in email clients that support that. (fixes issues  334, 452, and 480)
- Indefero can now be configured to record activity metrics for all projects
  in a forge. This needs a special cron job named 'activitycron.php` 
  (under `scripts`) that is run on a regular basis. The metrics can be
  fine-tuned via `activity_section_weights` and `activity_lookback` in
  `idf.php` and the result is visible as green bar in the project list view.
- The forge's project list has been overhauled - its now possible to attach
  labels on projects and to filter and order the project list by various
  criteria. Additionally, projects can now get an external project URL
  configured that is displayed as linkable icon right beside the project name
  (if available)
- Forge administrators can furthermore configure an alternative entry page
  for the forge that is displayed instead of the plain project list. This
  page accepts standard Markdown syntax and has support for the new
  `projectlist` macro that allows the (partial) inline rendering of the
  known global project list. 
- It is now also possible to configure a web hook that informs an external
  URL about new and updated downloads for a specific project, similar to the
  available post-commit web hook.
- One can now upload multiple files at once by using a special archive format
  which Indefero processes in the background and for which individual upload
  records are created.

## Bugfixes

- Ensure that IDF does not break UTF-8 encoded strings when
  shortening them for view rendering (issue 785)
- Indefero no longer confuses a non-owner of an issue with a notification that
  a particular ticket has been opened and assigned to him (fixes issue 562)

# InDefero 1.2.1 - XXX XXX XX XX:XX:XX UTC 201X

## Bugfixes

- The diff view now renders properly in Firefox when a minimum font size
  is configured or the user zooms the web page (fixes issue 773)

## Language and Translations

- Multiple fixes to English source strings (fixes issues 763, 766, and 772,
  thanks to JP Fleury!)

or newer to properly run this version of Indefero!

## New Features

- Indefero's issue tracker can now bi-directionally link issues with variable,
  configurable terms, such as "is related to", "is blocked by" or
  "is duplicated by" (issue 638)
- When you search for issues, the results can further be refined by issue state
  (open or closed) and label (partially implements issue 548)
- Source and diff views now make characters like line endings, tabs and other
  "invisible" control characters visible on hover and cope with long lines much
  better (issue 636)
- Mercurial source views now show parent revisions (if any) and detailed change
  information
- Subversion source views now show detailed change information (issue 622)
- File download URLs now contain the file name rather than the upload id;
  old links still work though (issues 559 and 686)
- monotone file and directory attributes are displayed in the tree and file view
  (needs a monotone with an interface version of 13.1 or newer)
- The context area is now kept in view when a page scrolls down several pages
- A summary section has been added to the issue tracker with statistics about
  open / closed  issues, unresolved issues grouped by tags and owners
- The project list and title has gathered a customizable icon for each project
- The download section now provides MD5 checksums for uploaded files
- Wiki pages now come with a designated stylesheet for printer output (issue 713)

## Bugfixes

- The SVN interface acts more robust if an underlying repository has been
  restructured (issues 364 and 721)

  actually access to (issue 655)

  uploaded keys has been improved (issue 679)

- The SVN command line client no longer accidential tries to store the login
  credentials we give him as arguments for the user executing the SVN command
- The usher section in the forge administration no longer displays a bogus
  server enty in case no monotone server is configured in the connected
  usher instance
- A timeout that popped up when Usher is restarted has been fixed (issue 695)
- The SyncMonotone plugin now cleans up partial artifacts it created during the
  addition of a new project or monotone key, in case an error popped up in the
  middle (issue 697)
- Indefero now sends the MD5 checksum as HTTP header when downloading a file from the
  download area; additionally, a unneeded redirect has been removed (issue 716)
- Source links without a specific revision did not work due to a wrong regex
  (issue 730)
- Avatar URL generation use correctly the configuration (issue 732)
- The SyncGit plugin no longer fails to remove a non-existing post-update hook
  on repository creation (issue 752)
- When uploading a project logo, an existing uploaded file with the same name
  no longer leads to an error, but is simple overwritten (fixes issue 740)
- The error detection and reporting in the SyncMonotone plugin has been improved
- The branch links users of the Subversion frontend get when they enter a wrong
  revision are fixed; this list is now also only displayed (for any SCM) if
  there are actually branches available in the repository
- If git's author name is not encoded in an UTF-8 compatible encoding, skip the
  author lookup, as we have no information what the author string is actually
  encoded in
- Indefero no longer displays an empty parents paragraph in the commit view for
  root revisions of a git repository
- Indefero now only shows the tags of the closed and not the open issues in the
  closed issues list
